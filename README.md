# Introduction to **common**
<img src='man/images/common1.png' align="left" height="138" style="margin-right:10px"/>

When working in Base R, there are some situations where you stop and wonder:
"Why isn't there a function to do that?" For example:

- Why isn't there a function in Base R to sort a data frame by multiple columns?
- Why isn't there a function in Base R to get the path of the current program?
- In Base R, why is there no infix operator for concatenation?
- Why isn't there a function in Base R to add/modify data frame labels?

The answer to all of the above questions is that there should be.
The purpose of the **common** package is encapsulate those types of functions,
and provide them to R users in a lightweight package.  These functions
are particularly useful for package developers, who might want to add
these capabilities to their package without creating dependencies on 
**tidyverse**.

If you have ideas for more **common** functions, please submit
your suggestion to the github 
[issue list](https://github.com/dbosak01/common/issues).


### Installation

The easiest way to install the **common** package is to run the following 
command from your R console:

    install.packages("common")


Then put the following line at the top of your script:

    library(common)
    
For examples and usage 
information, please visit the **common** documentation site 
[here](https://common.r-sassy.org/articles/common.html)
