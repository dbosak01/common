\title{Source all programs in a directory}
\usage{
source.all(path = ".", pattern = NULL, exclude = NULL, isolate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The directory to source programs from.  Default is the current
working directory.}

\item{pattern}{A full or partial name of the programs to source.  If partial,
use the question mark (?) or asterisk (*) characters to indicate
the missing piece(s). Default is NULL, which will return all programs.
You may pass multiple patterns as a vector.  In that case, the function
will perform an "or" operation on each pattern. Note that it is not necessary
to include the ".R" file extension in your patterns. It is assumed that all
source files have a ".R" extension.}

\item{exclude}{A vector of patterns to exclude from the included programs.
The exclusion patterns can be the names of specific programs or a wild card
exclusion. The asterisk (*)
and question mark (?) characters may be used to indicate partial matches.
Similar to the "pattern" parameter, the ".R" file extension can be ignored.}

\item{isolate}{Whether to isolate each source call to its own environment.
Valid values are TRUE, FALSE, or an environment to run in.  If the isolate
parameter is FALSE, the programs will run in the global environment. Default
is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the results of the source operation. The
data frame will show each file sourced, the time started, the time ended,
the status, and any error messages. The status value is either 0 (no errors)
or 1 (errors).
}
\description{
A function to source all programs in a specified directory.
The function will run each R program file in the directory, and then
return a data frame of results of the run.
}
\details{
The \code{source.all} function attempts to run all programs in a directory.
This function is useful for batch runs.  It has parameters to control
which programs are run or not run.  By default, the function will run
all programs in the working directory.  You can use the "pattern" and
"exclude" parameters to specify individual program names, or wild card matches.
Inclusion and exclusion patterns are case-insensitive.

Note that the function will run all programs, regardless of any errors.
Errors will be indicated in the "Status" and "Message" columns of the result
dataset.
}
\section{Result Dataset}{

The \code{source.all} function returns a dataset showing the results of the
source operation. There will be one row for each program executed. The
return dataset has the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item{\strong{Filename}: The name of the program.}
  \item{\strong{StartTime}: The date and time execution started.}
  \item{\strong{EndTime}: The date and time execution ended.}
  \item{\strong{Status}: A 0 or 1 value indicating wether the program returned
  without errors. A zero (0) value indicated that no errors occured.}
  \item{\strong{Message}: If errors are returned from the program, they
  will be shown in this column.}
}
In addition to the information shown above, the results dataset will have
attributes assigned with the parameter values passed to the function. Those
attributes can be observed with the Base R \code{attributes()} function.
}

\section{Source Isolation}{

Multiple programs running in the same environment have a risk of conflicting
variables or data. Variables created by the first program can possibly interfere
with the running of the next program.  Or they could conflict with variables
in the global environment. To avoid such conflicts, each program
is run in its own environment by default. \code{isolate = TRUE} starts each program
with a clean workspace, and is the best choice for running programs in
batch.

There may be situations, however, where you do not want to isolate the
source calls.  For example, if you are loading functions from a utility
library, you may actually wanted them loaded into the global environment
so they can by accessed by you or your programs.  In this case, set the
"isolate" parameter to FALSE.

Lastly, there may be situations where you want to intentionally share an
environment, or extract values create by the running programs.
In this case, you can instantiate a new environment
yourself, and pass that to the "isolate" parameter instead of TRUE or FALSE.
Note that this environment will be shared by all programs, but will not have
access to the global environment.
