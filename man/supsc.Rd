\usage{
supsc(x)
}

\description{
The \code{supsc} function translates a normal character to a UTF-8
superscript character.  The function can be used to
generate superscripts for many common characters.  Most alphabetic
and numeric characters have UTF-8 superscripts.  This function is useful
because it saves you from having to look up the superscript character
code, or copy and pasting from the internet.  If a corresponding
superscript character code does not exist, a question mark
will be returned for that character.
